# project management

## 70 / 20 / 10 rule

* 70% of the time should be spend on things that happen now
* 20% of the time should be spent on things that are next
* 10% of the time should be spent on things spent on things for later

## 80 / 20

80% of the value comes from 20% of x. Find out what x is and cut down the rest.

## Sprint planning

* Can use GH issues for this.
* sprint goals
  * human readable goal of the sprint
* sprint participants
  * @mentions
* sprint deliverables
  * per person
  * triage section (anyone can pick these up)

## Project request considerations

* What is the goal of the project?
* How will you and your client determine if the project is successful?
* What returns will you and your clients see as a result of the project?
* Who will participate from the client side?
* What range of services does the project require?
* What is your clientâ€™s budget for the project?
* Is there technology involved? If yes, what is the technology?
* Does your client employ anyone with expertise on the topic?
* What is the timeline for the project, and will your client require your
  services after your work is complete?
