# networking

Unix networking stuff.

## TCP / IP networking model

```
layer 0
  physical layer
  standards for voltages, frequencies and other physical properties

layer 1
  link layer
  communication with devices that share a physical connection
  Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n, and Token Ring

layer 2
  network layer
  talk to machines without knowing where they are physically located
  IP

layer 3
  transport layer
  determine which program to deliver messages to, usually through port numbers
  TCP, UDP

layer 4
  application layer protocol
  set of protocols for a specific program
  HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3
```

On top of that there are an infinite amount of layers, most commonly:

```
layer 5
  security layer
  make sure communication is private
  TLS, SSL

layer 6
  API layer
  talk to a program living within the application layer
  Twitter API, GitHub API
```

But these layers are not fixed, sometimes protocols switch between layers. OSI,
for example, has 7 layers.

## UDP
* unreliable
* little overhead

## TCP
* reliable (retries)
* overhead
