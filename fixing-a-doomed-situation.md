# fixing a doomed situation

Observe, note and then give examples.

## Statement
> I noticed that in the discussion around #11 comments were removed.

## Details of the statement
> After a while the discussion is locked and closed, but after a couple of days
> a participant with moderation abilities uses his power to make another comment
> which is part of the discussion, but to which no reply is possible.

## Opinion
### Summarize your opinion
> My opinion on whether these comments needed to be deleted is beside the point,
> but I don't like the effects it had, nor do I agree with the way it was
> handled:

### Bullet point of what's up
> * Moderation was done by people with a strong opinion on the issue itself.
>   This kills the credibility of the moderators and exposes the advisory board to (valid) concerns about censorship.
> * There is no safety net to ensure that moderators don't overstep their limits.
>   Even for advisory board members there is no way to tell what comments were removed, for what reason and by whom.
> * What remains public are replies to comments that were removed, often containing an
>   interpretation (or caricature) of the removed comment.

## Solution
> What I would like to suggest:
> * Discussion participants don't moderate discussions, neither do people who are known to have a strong
>   opinion about the topic of the debate.
> * When comments are removed or edited, or people are banned, this is logged somewhere, including (where applicable)
>   the name of the moderator, the offensive comment and reasons for moderation.
>   It could be as simple as an e-mail to a group of people. (needs further detail)
> * The moderator leaves a note in the thread clearly stating that moderation has happened and the motivation.
> * Replies to deleted comments are also deleted.
> * When a discussion is closed and locked, nobody is allowed to continue the discussion, not even the people that
>   technically can. Only authoritative statements are allowed (e.g. "the discussion continues there" or "In the
>   December 1st meeting the advisory has decided to do x").
