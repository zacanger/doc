# Node For Beginners

Some things you should do right away:
* Install node. Go to <https://nodejs.org> and get the installer appropriate for
  your OS.
* Make sure it stays up to date. If you're on Mac or Linux, use NPM to install
  N: `npm i -g n`; using N is simple, just do `n latest` to get the latest Node
  and NPM.
  * If you're on windows, check out <https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist>.
* Install some helpful global modules: `npm i -g live-server luvi bower`. I'm
  suggesting both live-server and luvi because the code live-server injects to
  refresh the page can sometimes conflict with client-side JS (like Angular).
* If you're getting permissions errors, you'll need to own the directory where
  Node installs modules. Rather than running `sudo` before every NPM command,
  just take ownership of `/usr/local` with the command `chown -R yourusername
  /usr/local`.

## What?
Node is a JavaScript runtime. It's a program (usually run from the command line)
which executes JavaScript, and comes with a built-in library for writing network
and filesystem code.  Node is built on [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/), the
same JavaScript VM used in the Chrome browser.  Instead of being wrapped with a
GUI and web browser features like the DOM, node wraps V8 to expose lower-level
operating system APIs.  Some modules that come with node include: `http`, `fs`
(filesystem), `crypto` (cryptography), and lots more.

### What's a module?
Modules are chunks of code you can 'require' and then use.  Today we'll use the
`http` module, like so:

```javascript
const http = require('http')
```

`require` is a function built into node.  It takes a string module name and
returns that module.

### You can make your own modules!

```javascript
// my-module.js
module.exports = 'hey!'

// app.js
const myModule = require('./my-module')
console.log(myModule)
```

Notice the require string is now a relative path, and that we've emitted the
`.js`.  It's optional for the `js` extension.

Modules are great for breaking your code down into smaller pieces that are
easier to think about.

## `http` module
This is what we'll be using today, but first...

### The network stack
- HTTP
- TLS (optional)
- TCP
- IP
- Ethernet
- Physical card

Try this: `ping www.google.com`

You should see an IP address in parenthesis that will be used for subsequent
pings.  Where'd that address come from?  This is the IP layer, specifically a
DNS (Domain Name Service) lookup.

Try pinging again using that IP address instead.  The results should be the
same.

Now try this: `telnet www.google.com 80`

This is the next layer up: TCP.  Telnet is a tool for working with TCP
connections.  The command above says to open a TCP connection with
`www.google.com` on port `80`, which is the default for non-secure web traffic.

HTTP is the next layer after TCP (in a non-secure connection), so let's try
some!

```
(still inside the telnet prompt)
GET / HTTP/1.1
```

Did you get all the HTML back?  We can do everything above in one step with `curl`:
`curl www.google.com`

`curl` is an HTTP tool.

### Ok, back to node!
Make a new directory to work in, then create a `server.js` file in that
directory.  Edit that file so it looks like this:

```javascript
const http = require('http')
```

### What is Non-blocking IO?
When PHP hits a line that requires an IO operation, like a database read/write,
PHP basically pauses execution at that line and hands over control to the
database software to execute the command. Once the operation on the database
completes, the control is given back to PHP and executes the commands after that
line. This is blocking, because the database operation "blocks" PHP execution
until it completes. With the same situation, NodeJS does this by asynchronously
calling the IO operation. This means that while the operation is ongoing on the
database, NodeJS proceeds in doing other stuff like cater the next request. When
the IO operation completes, NodeJS runs the handler that was set to handle the
data when the operation completes.  Great for RESTful APIs

```javascript
// server.js
const
  http      = require('http')
, server    = http.createServer()
, port      = process.env.PORT || 4444
, onRequest = (req, res) => {
	res.statusCode = 200
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block')
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
	res.end('<h1>Hello world</h1>')
}
server.on('request', onRequest)
server.listen(port)
console.log(`server listening on ${port}`)
```

Run using `node server`.

Now make a really simple html page that tries to access the endpoint they just
created. Make sure they understand that we're using jQuery/$.get as just a
really simple way to make a web request. We've done this with Angular services
up to this point.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.6/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // $http in Angular. $.get in jQuery.
    $(function(){$.get('http://localhost:4444')})
  </script>
</head>
</html>
```

Open the file using live-server or luvi. Open the network tab and examine the
request and response.

### Quick Tips
- `$ node -v` see what version of node you are using
- `$ chmod u+x myscript.js` make your javascript file executable
- `#!/usr/bin/env node` use this shebang at the top of all node files you want to be executable
- Using ES6 Modules and ES7 in Node: `npm i -g babel-cli`, then run programs
  with `babel-node` instead of `node`.
