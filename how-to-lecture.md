State objectives at the beginning (so they can see what we're trying to achieve).

Some ways to organize a lecture:
- Turn the topic into an exploration of a problem to be solved. Frame the topic as one or two questions to crack together.
- Present relevant facts and concepts similarly to how a lawyer might.
	- Present the other side's 'case' as well!
	- Lead the 'jury' here to the right conclusions.
- Or just show them how much easier it is to do things this way?
	- That isn't really applicable all the time....
	- Dramatic display right up front could sway the nonbelievers, though.
- One could also start things off with a story.
	- Brief anecdote about whatever the topic is, possibly of the 'this is how person X broke product Y, and how we can do things better with today\'s subject matter in our heads' variety.

Keep in mind that the average attention span only allows for about 10 minutes at a stretch, so plan for short breaks. That'll provide time for Q&A, troubleshooting, catching up, etc., too.

If using slides, focus more on visuals (graphs--Mermaid?). For text, use just keywords whenever possible.

Throw in jokes. Which means, I guess, go figure out how to be funny, first. Crap.

Use examples. Maybe run through examples, not just mention them. Like a full starting a project through pushing to Github the _slow_ way, and then also how _I_ do it.

Proof-read. Fact-check. Practice.

In general, during breaks in the lecture, consider having students write a one-minute-ish synopsis of what's been covered so far. Helps to clarify areas that were covered too weakly, or which weren't grasped by the student. The 'Think, Pair, Share' thing could also work here (pose a question, about which the student writes briefly; compare answers with another student for a minute or two; have a pair present their solutions, and see if any pair did them differently, and if so, why). Another option would be to give a problem and have students break into small groups for a few minutes to solve it. Silence is also okay, too, though, so don't stress about this too much.

Feel free to speak with the hands--it helps keep students' attention focused.

Eye. Contact. Just do it. It won't kill you.

Walk around a bit, maybe? If possible.

Repeat, and _emphasize_, the major points.

Repeat, and _emphasize_, the key facts (especially important syntax things, and names of things, etc.).

Heh, I guess doing the whole 'tell them what you\'re going to say, then say it, then tell them what you\'ve just said' thing could be good here.

Present a visible outline of the lecture, and return to it regularly to show progress and reinforce key points.

Make explicit, but connected, transitions between topics. That is, end a topic with a (very) short summary, and begin the next one from that summary. An example of this might be moving from git aliases to Legit, or from file and directory operations to automating them.

Speak clearly, and project, but keep a conversational tone. Remember that this is a chance to talk _with_ people about the subject, not _at_ them.

Be enthusiastic! I mean, y'know. Show it. Or something.

--------

Some very short things to keep in mind for _every_ lecture.

Can the students do something at the end of the lecture that they couldn't do before it, intuitively?

Can they explain the practical use of what was learned to someone who hasn't taken this course?

Introduction:
	- Practical problem
	- Summarised argument
	- How the problem and argument fit into the course
	- The _stake_

Body:
	- Theory --\
	- History ---   As solutions to the problem
	- Skills --/
	- Match theoretical/position peieces with empirical/historical exemplars
		- These could be presented as a _stake_
	- Present counterarguments, especially to things that are intuitively understood

Conclusion:
	- Summarise the knowledge and skills the students should now have
