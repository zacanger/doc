## UI

### Systems

* Modular is good
* Cards are good
* Systems are good
* Consistency is good

#### Future Trends:

* Design systems
* Designing for change
* Designing personalized experiences

### Elements

Interfaces are composed of small components, which are composed of small primitives.
This lowest granular level only consists of a few elements:

* Buttons
* Forms
* Lists

Everything else is usually a superset of these elements.

### Trends

Don't buy into the hype. Not everything is a good thing. A lot of things are actually
really bad things, especially for the users you might not be considering.

* Parallax -- good for flashiness, bad for a11y, users, browsers
* Card -- good all around, for the right application
* Media object -- an example of the _elements_ way of doings, the 'poster child of oocss'
* Infinite scroll -- again, looks cool, but all around actually a very bad thing to do
* Smooth scroll -- it's not necessarily harmful, but it's not exactly fantastic, either

### Natural Language Form

Forms that aren't just inputs. Mad-libs style, so one doesn't have a giant box of empty
boxes to fill in, but instead something like
[I want my username to be {username} and my password to be {password}](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007), or
[I'm looking for {restaurant} in {city} at {time}.](http://www.jroehm.com/2014/01/ui-pattern-natural-language-form/)

### Empty States

* Zero-data states
* [When there's no content](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/empty-states.html)
* Should not just be an afterthought
* [Excellent Examples](http://emptystat.es)
