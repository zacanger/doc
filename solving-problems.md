Basic steps of solving programming problems:

1. Find the input.
1. Find the output.
1. Figure out how you need to transform the input to the output _in plain English_.
1. Translate this into your chosen programming language.
1. Run the code (in your head, or on a machine).
1. If the output isn't what you expected, start over with step three.
