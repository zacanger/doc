# Graphics

## WebGL
WebGL is the umbrella term for graphics programming technologies in the
browser. It's part GLSL (GL Shading Language) and JavaScript. GLSL is a
graphics language based on OpenGL, that has a C like syntax.

### Vectors
```txt
vec4 vector;
vector[0] = vector.r = vector.x = vector.s;
vector[1] = vector.g = vector.y = vector.t;
vector[2] = vector.b = vector.z = vector.p;
vector[3] = vector.a = vector.w = vector.q;
```

##### Swizzle
Changing the position of vector properties to create new values. E.g.
```glsl
vec3 green = vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
vec3 magenta = green.rbg;
```

### Uniforms
GLSL is deterministic, doesn't have memory management and operates on every
pixel of the canvas. In order for dynamic behavior to happen, shaders have a
concept of uniforms. Uniforms are a bridge from JavaScript to GLSL. These can
be any value, though common values to transmit are `screenResolution` and
`globalTime`. Uniforms are commonly prepended with `i`. Here's an overview of
commonly defined uniforms:
```txt
float iGlobalTime    Time in milliseconds, increments linearly
vec3  iResolution    Canvas size in xyz, where z is always 0
```

### Built-ins
GLSL has built-in functions and built-in variables.

```txt
vec4 gl_FragCoord  Location of the pixel on the screen, has an xyzw component
```

### glslify
glslify brings NPM to GLSL; the hot sauce to the steam buns. Instead of
copy-and-pasting large snippets of code, it enables you to import those
snippets as modules instead. This allows for more focused user-facing code,
that can be understood by more people than just the author. Imports are defined
and consumed in pragmas, so the glslify specific code is neatly tucked away
in a single location.
```glsl
#pragma glslify: camera = require('glsl-turntable-camera')
```

### Shaping functions
Shaping functions are the corner stone of algorithmic drawing. Essential to
generate anything with WebGL.

### Noise functions
- curl noise: used for particle motion, particular useful for smoke and other similar effects
- perlin noise: kind of like photoshop's cloud filter
- simplex noise: similar to perlin noise, but a hella lot faster
