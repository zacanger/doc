## kimchi

Baechu, or napa cabbage, kimchi is made by lacto-fermentation, the same process
that creates sauerkraut and traditional dill pickles. In the first stage, the
cabbage is soaked in a salty brine that kills off harmful bacteria. In the
second stage, the remaining Lactobacillus bacteria (the good guys!) convert
sugars into lactic acid, which preserves the vegetables and gives them that
wonderful, tangy flavor.

### Ingredients

* 1 (2-pound) head napa cabbage
* 1/4 cup sea salt or kosher salt (see Recipe Notes)
* Water (see Recipe Notes)
* 1 tablespoon grated garlic (about 5-6 cloves)
* 1 teaspoon grated ginger
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2-3 tablespoons seafood flavor or water (optional, see Recipe Notes)
* 1-5 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)
* 8 ounces Korean radish or daikon, peeled and cut into matchsticks
* 4 scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

### Gear

* Cutting board and knife
* Large bowl
* Gloves (optional but highly recommended)
* Plate and something to weigh the kimchi down, like a jar or can of beans
* Colander
* Small bowl
* Clean 1-quart jar with canning lid or plastic lid
* Bowl or plate to place under jar during fermentation

### Instructions

#### Cut the cabbage.

Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters and remove the cores. Cut each quarter
crosswise into 2-inch-wide strips.

#### Salt the cabbage.

Place the cabbage and salt in a large bowl. Using your hands (gloves optional),
massage the salt into the cabbage until it starts to soften a bit, then add
water to cover the cabbage. Put a plate on top and weigh it down with something
heavy, like a jar or can of beans. Let stand for 1-2 hours.

#### Rinse and drain the cabbage.

Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3 times and drain in a colander for 15-20
minutes. Rinse and dry the bowl you used for salting, and set it aside to use
in step 5.

#### Make the paste.

Meanwhile, combine the garlic, ginger, sugar, and seafood flavor (or 3
tablespoons water) in a small bowl and mix to form a smooth paste. Mix in the
gochugaru, using 1 tablespoon for mild and up to 5 tablespoons for spicy (I
like about 3 1/2 tablespoons).

#### Combine the vegetables and paste.

Gently squeeze any remaining water from the cabbage and return it to the bowl
along with the radish, scallions, and seasoning paste.

#### Mix thoroughly.

Using your hands, gently work the paste into the vegetables until they are
thoroughly coated. The gloves are optional here but highly recommended to
protect your hands from stings, stains, and smells!

#### Pack the kimchi into the jar.

Pack the kimchi into the jar, pressing down on it until the brine rises to
cover the vegetables. Leave at least 1-inch of headspace. Seal the jar with te
lid.

#### Let it ferment.

Let the jar stand at room temperature for 1-5 days. You may see bubbles inside
the jar and brine may seep out of the lid; place a bowl or plate under the jar
to help catch any overflow.

#### Check it daily and refrigerate when ready.

Check the kimchi once a day, pressing down on the vegetables with a clean
finger or spoon to keep them submerged under the brine. (This also releases
gases produced during fermentation.) Taste a little at this point, too! When
the kimchi tastes ripe enough for your liking, transfer the jar to the
refrigerator. You may eat it right away, but it's best after another week or
two.
