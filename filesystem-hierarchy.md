test             -> tests
```

## Project Filesystem Hierarchy

## Personal filesystem hierarchy

Or, how to structure your personal documents well. If you want. It's a way that works.

```
etc/              other
  pwd/            `pass(1)` password files
lib/              resources that can be consumed
log/              scanned materials, sorted by date (2011, 2012, etc.)
media/            media
  cam/            img from camera
  read/           books, articles and the like
  screen/         screenshots
  tmp/            images that don't belong in any of the above
  vid/            movies, gifs
  wall/           wallpapers
  write/          stories, notes, posts
tmp/              temporary files
