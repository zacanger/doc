# Doing Research Before an Interview

The importance of doing your research before an interview cannot be stressed
enough. Most job seekers fall short in this area, spending just a half hour the
morning of the interview and not doing a thorough enough job.

**Important:** Don't start your research the morning of the interview.

At a minimum, prepare to spend 1-2 hours doing research on the people/company
and preparing questions for your interviewers. This is in addition to any
technical interview prep you’re doing (e.g. practicing algorithms, whiteboarding
etc.).

## Why Interview Research is Important

While your resume may get your foot in the door, know that you’ll be expected to
answer really specific questions about the company and the role and why you
would add value. As you’re doing research you're going to go into the interview
more confident because you’ll feel more prepared and informed about the
conversation ahead of you.

When you do research on a company it’ll help you answer questions that might
come up for you, like “Is this company a fit for me?”

In the following sections, we'll cover the three main categories of interview
research: Job, People, and Company.

## Job Research

The day before your interview, re-read EVERY LINE of the job description you
were sent (if applicable). The higher up in the job description something is
listed, the more important it probably is in the day-to-day work of the job.

You will probably be asked questions related to the bullet points on a job
description. These bullet points will likely cover very specific
responsibilities of the role in addition to qualities/skills they’re looking for
in a candidate.

If bullets mention work with APIs, scraping, or working with large teams, be
prepared to talk about that stuff.

If bullets mention “you like sharing knowledge and are comfortable working in
ambiguity” make sure you have specific examples that demonstrate this.

If the jobs says it requires 5 years of Ruby experience (and you don’t have
that) does that mean you’re not qualified? No. Not at all.

Remember that job descriptions are a *wishlist* for employers and are a guide
for you to get a sense of what a company is looking for in an ideal candidate
and the range of expectations the company has for the person taking on this
role.

If you’re not sent a job description (or there isn’t one posted for the role
you’re interviewing for), look at other job descriptions on the site that can
give you a sense of company culture and values. And do all the other research
below.

## People Research

If you have more than one interviewer, research all of them.  Researching your
interviewer enables you to learn who they are as a person first and also aim to
develop a rapport/connection with them as soon as you walk in the door.

Keep an eye out for the following:

* Similar backgrounds (hometown/state, alma mater, degree, previous employers)
* Technologies they build with
* Mutual connections

The more you know about your interviewer, the less nervous you will likely feel,
and the more you can be yourself.

Keep in mind that anything you may reference in an interview that comes as a
result of your research should be professional (not that you like the same bar
they liked on Facebook).

### Google your interviewer

Type your interviewer’s name in quotes [“FirstName LastName”] to get the best
matched results. View not just the first page of hits, but the first five. This
is being thorough.

Here are the things you should be looking for:

* GitHub profile
* Blog
* Twitter profile
* Articles they’ve published
* Recordings of talks they gave at conferences
* Other places they are present on the internet

Have they built apps similar to yours, worked on similar initiatives, used
similar technologies?

This helps you get a sense of what is important to your interviewer and ways you
can make conversation with him/her and what you can highlight in your answer.

For example, and if appropriate, it’s  okay to reference a few posts of theirs
that you‘ve read, in interviews and in your follow up/thank you notes.

**Finding and watching online videos of your interviewer is especially
valuable,** as they give you a much more real, ‘high definition’ experience of
them and their personality than by just reading a blog post. Take advantage of
this to tailor your communication style with them.

### Look up your interviewer on LinkedIn

Don’t think that “stalking” your interviewer on LinkedIn is a bad thing.
“Stalking” your interviewer on LinkedIn is a must! Use LinkedIn to research
items such as their alma mater, their previous employer, noteworthy projects
they’ve worked on, technologies they use in their role, etc.

Having this knowledge and articulating it is actually flattering, and shows that
you are serious and did your research.

### Look up your interviewer’s colleagues on LinkedIn

Researching your interviewer’s colleagues gives you a sense of the size of the
team, who your new colleagues might be, the team structure, what each member
does in their role, and what technologies they’re building with.

Additionally, if you’ve read the profiles of 10 of your interviewers colleagues,
and you happen to be asked to meet “a few other people in the office” after your
initial interview you’ll feel more comfortable because you’ve done your
research!

### Look for trends

Once you have looked up your interviewer and their colleagues, look for trends
among them. Trends can help you gain a better sense of the sort of environment
you’re going into. For example: Do most of the devs on the team have Computer
Science degrees? If so, you should most definitely be ready to answer some
algorithm or logic problems.

(Sidenote: Knowing where their colleagues previously worked also gives you ideas
of other companies that might interest you that you should research as well for
potential pursuit.)

## Company Research

Today, employers expect you to have scoured the internet for information about
them. After all, how can you truly ‘give your all’ to a company if you don’t
understand (and can’t articulate) what they’re about?

If you haven’t done thorough company research, then you’re not prepared, and
that is a strike against you.

### Know the names of the CEO and CTO

This is common sense basic information that out of respect you should be aware
of. Smart interviewers might ask you this, helping them weed out insincere or
lazy candidates. If you’re not asked and there is no reason for you to bring it
up in an interview, then don’t mention it.

### Research the company across the internet

Look up the company thoroughly across the internet to get a big-picture view of
them. The stuff to look out for is below:

* Year company was founded and by whom
* Company mission
* Core product / what the company does
* Their company culture
* Corporate priorities
* Current company news
* Technologies they are using/building
* Who their competitors are
* Do they allow employee contribution to open-source projects
* How they talk about what they do (language, keywords, terminologies, etc.).

Having this information only helps you better tailor your message/communications
with them. You can find this information in various places such as:

* Company website
* Company blog
* Facebook Page
* Company Tweets
* Relevant industry new blogs/websites (like [techcrunch.com](http://techcrunch.com/), etc.)
* On [builtwith.com](http://builtwith.com/) (to see what technologies they use)
* [Angel List](https://angel.co/)


### Research the company on LinkedIn

View the company’s LinkedIn Company Page, follow them to get relevant company
updates in your daily news feed, and as mentioned above, research their
employees themselves to get a sense of their organizational structure and size,
as well as the general education and skills they value and seek in candidates.

### Talk to current or previous employees

Reaching out to a current or former employee of a company is a super savvy
practice that most candidates bypass completely. There is no better place to get
a true inside look at an organization than by people who are working there/have
worked there.

This is not the time to reach out to strangers who work at the company. If you
reach out to someone you don’t know at a company and ask for advice on how to
approach their interview process, they’re likely to alert a hiring manager and
that could jeopardize your candidacy. The only appropriate way to do this is to
reach out to someone you know who currently works at or who previously worked at
the company, tell them you’ve secured an interview at their current/previous
company and ask if they have a few minutes to chat about their experiences
working there and if they have any advice for how to approach the interview
process. What you’re mainly going to glean from these kinds of conversations is
a better sense of the company culture and how you can tailor your message
appropriately.

### Start-ups and small companies

At start-ups and small companies, cultivating a very specific type of company
culture is often one of their biggest priorities, with the soft skills of
employees being just as valued as (if not more than) their actual technical
skills.

In turn, make sure you are doing adequate research on such elements for these
types of companies, so you can best ‘speak their language’, ask strong questions
(we address this in a future lesson), and market yourself accordingly.

### Formulating interview questions

Keep in mind when you’re researching that questions will pop up in your mind. In
a future lesson we will talk about the types of questions to ask in the
interview and how to formulate them, based on the research you’ve done ahead of
time.

## Conclusion

Doing thorough research before an interview as detailed above not only helps you
prepare and be more confident, but also helps you build a strong first
impression.

The more time and effort you put into your research the more you will appear as
a genuinely interested, responsible, and valuable professional, with a strong
work ethic.

After all, if you aren’t showing a company that you’re willing to go all out to
prepare and capture their attention and interest for a job interview, there is
no reason for them to think that you’d do this as an employee.
