Random docs.

Cheat-sheets, manpages, notes, infographics.

Use them, if you'd like. You could do something like: `git clone https://github.com/zacanger/doc.git
~/doc` so that they'd always be around.

This isn't maintained, so docs for active projects (like React) may be out of date.

All docs are under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md) unless otherwise noted, so feel free to copy them
around as long as you include the notice.
