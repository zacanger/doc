Owning stuff, doing stuff.

## morning ritual

Consistency is king. If you have kids you have to be the responsible one.
Thinking about this can keep you more sane. Even if you can't always make the
full ritual, it's good to have one. Best days are when you can make the full
length.

```txt
06.25 / drink a glass of lemon water
06.30 / stretch – exercise – stretch
07.00 / shower – get dressed
07.15 / take a moment to apply some face serum and moisturizer
07.17 / put on music, make the bed
07.20 / write a mini schedule and to do list for the day
07.30 / prepare some breakfast
07.45 / eat breakfast together
08.00 / pack lunch
08.20 / enter workspace
```

## deal with being possessive

* tell your partner what's bothering you
* explain why it is that it bothers you, how it makes you feel
* don't try to change the other person
* find the underlying reasons for why things make you feel the way they do
* (fears? previous experiences?)
