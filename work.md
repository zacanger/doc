# work

* The key to productivity is to make your hours count.
* Don't FB at work, answer personal email, gossip or other stuff.
* Have a life besides work.
* Don't work after 6pm.
* You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.

## Time management
* Reserve easier chores for the end of the day.
* If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
* Break your week open in segments, plan on a macro scale.
* Plan your day in segments, what are you going complete today?
* Have fixed moments for email / code review / other stuff. This gives you headspace.
