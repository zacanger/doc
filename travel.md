## Booking a plane

* clear cache often, prices are set by cookies
* early vs last minute bookings? no idea which one is best
* most people often already have a cancellation insurance, don't get one twice
* be careful you don't tick extra options when travelling with a cheap company,
  this is how they make money
* smaller airports often have better prices
* check if the flight no. you're planning to go on is available somewhere else,
  sometimes the same flight is available for less somewhere else

## Planning a trip

* Investigate when you want to travel first, off-season can save 80% in costs
* Check out what you can do in the towns you're heading at. Make a day by day plan.
* Never _just go somewhere_, planning on site is a waste of vacation time.
